"""Constructs a new python project.

.. warning:: 
    Work In Progress. This module is in active development.

Based on user input this module constructs a new directory structure
including all files and folders required to start development of a new 
python project. It has been built to overcome the ongoing obsticle of
starting a new python project. It takes too long to setup boilerplate 
files, folders, etc when the majority of the projects undertaken use a
fundamentally homeomorphic, specified structure.

This module is a component of the TEMPYLATE project.
