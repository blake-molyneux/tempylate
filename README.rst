Construct and manage a new python project.

This package constructs a new python project, including all files and
folders required to start development of a new python project. It was
built to overcome the repetitive nature of starting a new python 
project. It takes the monotony of setting up boilerplate files, folders,
etc when the majority of the projects undertaken use a fundamentally
homeomorphous structure.

Purpose
-------

This repo serves a few purposes:

1. Personal learning.
2. Template for future python projects.
3. A reference repo.
4. Showcase my personal process.

Implementation
--------------

While python is flexible by design, there are a few generally accepted
structures. The most popular project layouts are implemented including:

A. Official

   - This is the project structure specified by the `PyPA`_.

B. Classic
C. Flat

So far NONE of these layouts are implemented fully.
